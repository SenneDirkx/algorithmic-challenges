# Leetcode
## A collection of my personal solutions to Leetcode.com problems

There is a folder for each problem with the solution inside. 
In the solution file you will also see the *score* my submission received in the form of **Runtime** and **Memory Usage**.

These solutions may vary in language used as I intend to show off my problem solving skills in different techniques and languages.
